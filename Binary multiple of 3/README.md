## Binary Multiple of 3

In this kata, your task is to create a regular expression capable of evaluating binary strings (strings with only ```1```s and ```0```s) and determining whether the given string represents a number divisible by 3.

Take into account that:

An empty string might be evaluated to true (it's not going to be tested, so you don't need to worry about it - unless you want)
The input should consist only of binary digits - no spaces, other digits, alphanumeric characters, etc.
There might be leading ```0```s.

Examples
```
multipleof3Regex.test('000') should be true
multipleof3Regex.test('001') should be false
multipleof3Regex.test('011') should be true
multipleof3Regex.test('110') should be true
multipleof3Regex.test(' abc ') should be false
```
